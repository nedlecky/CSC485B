### "We do things with ML algorithms that data scientists don't neded or want to."
### (And we put them into production.)
### Included here:
  * Course Syllabus, although the schedule is very fluid as this is our first offering!
  * Lecture Notes, again in draft form as we go
  * All of our test code is linked in, mostly as Python Jupyter Notebooks so far
### Your Comments and Feedback are MOST WELCOME
