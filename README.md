### "We do things with ML algorithms that data scientists aren't interested in and don't (want to) understand!"
### And we put them into production!
### Included here:
  * Class Syllabus is here, although the schedule is very fluid as this is our first offering!
  * Lecture Notes are here, again in draft form as we go
  * All of our test code is linked in, mostly as Python Jupyter Notebooks so far
### Your Comments and Feedback are MOST WELCOME
